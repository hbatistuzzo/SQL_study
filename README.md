1) Select OK
2) Where OK
3) Wildcards are extremely useful
	- SELECT * from movie_tables WHERE title = "story" will find a movie whose title is EXACTLY story
	- SELECT * from movie_tables WHERE title LIKE "story" will find a movie whose title is either story or Story or STORY etc
		- Use % with LIKE to match a sequence of 0 or more characters
			- SELECT * from movie_tables WHERE title LIKE "%story" will find Toy Story
			- SELECT * from movie_tables WHERE title LIKE "%story%" will find Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3
		- Use _ in a similar fashion, but to match exactly 1 character
			- SELECT * FROM movies WHERE Title LIKE "WALL-_" will find WALL-E and WALL-G, but would not find WALL-EEE if it existed.
